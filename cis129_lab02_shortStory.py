print('There once was a bird who was scared of the world. Not actually the world, I guess, but moreso of what lies in the world - the people, the creatures, the bad, even the good. He would not leave the nest, no matter what all the other birds would tell him, no matter how much they would encourage him. So he died in his nest, never stepping foot elsewhere... you thought this would be a happy story, huh? Moral is, don't stay stuck and scared - try new things before it's too late.')
